## 🧱 Where This Structure Comes From

This structure draws on patterns used in:

### 🧪 Research Labs & Reproducibility-Focused Projects
- OpenMMLab (e.g., MMDetection, MMAction)
- fairseq by Facebook AI
- PyTorch Lightning
- detectron2
- HuggingFace Transformers

These projects emphasize:
- Separation of what you want to do (config) from how you do it (code).
- Modular task + model + dataset design.
- Reusable components that can be swapped in.

## 🎯 Why It Works So Well
| Design Principle | How it shows up in your repo | 
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Separation of concerns | tasks/, models/, datasets/ split cleanly |
| Inversion of control | Config tells code what to do |
| Modular architecture | Swappable datasets/models/tasks |
| Single-responsibility | scripts/ do setup; tasks/ do work |
| Convention over configuration | File naming = behavior routing |

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used
Here are some real software design patterns embedded in your repo:

### 1. Factory Pattern (via get_model, get_dataset)
Lets you instantiate classes dynamically from strings in the config.

Avoids if-else spaghetti.

### 2. Strategy Pattern (via tasks/ per task)
Each task has its own implementation of train, eval, etc.

You can swap training strategies without modifying the rest.

### 3. Command Pattern (via CLI scripts)
scripts/train_model.py --config ... acts as a command dispatcher.

Separates interface from execution logic.

### 4. Dependency Injection (via config-driven design)
You’re not hardcoding models, datasets, or transforms.

They’re injected via YAML — very testable and flexible.

## 🧠 When (and Why) to Break It Apart
This structure can scale really far — but you may eventually want to split it up when:

| Symptom |	Signal to Break It Up |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| 10+ models, 5+ tasks | Consider creating separate repos per domain |
| Datasets or tasks need private data or infra | Split sensitive parts into internal subrepos |
| You want to publish 1 task/model as a pip package | Extract that submodule cleanly |
| Experiment tracking gets messy | Integrate W&B, MLflow, or a central database |

That said, many orgs run multi-million-parameter models with 10+ tasks from a monorepo like this.

## 🧪 Keeping Experiments Clean
You're right — experiment tracking is where things get messy if you don’t enforce discipline.

### 🔧 Suggestions:
Add a `logs/` or `experiments/` folder to store results and checkpoints, e.g.:

```text
experiments/
├── phase_classification/
│   ├── cat21_r3d/
│   │   ├── metrics.json
│   │   ├── config.yaml
│   │   └── model.pt
```

Use Weights & Biases or MLflow to track:
- Configs
- Training curves
- Artifacts (models, logs, images)
- Use `sweep/` configs for grid search or hyperparam tuning with clear output folders per run.

## 🔁 Scaling Suggestions
If you outgrow the monorepo:

Create a core repo (e.g. opticai-core) that includes:
- Datasets
- Model base classes
- Common utilities
- Then build per-task microrepos (e.g. `opticai-phase`, `opticai-segmentation`) that import it.

But keep it all here while you’re experimenting — the structure you have will carry you a long way 🚀
