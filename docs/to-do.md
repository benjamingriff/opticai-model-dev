# TODO

### 03/06/2025
- [] Sort out the final phase dict with a complete list of phases for Cat21 and Cat101
- [] Make sure all of Cat21 phase map to the final phase dict
- [] Implement a phase map across for Cat101 that map to the final phase dict
- [] Capture not initialised as part of Cat101 in the _load_samples funciton
- [] Check that there are no extra samples past the last phase classification and if there are clssify them as not initialised
- [] Ensure split.py can split across multiple datasets and not just the first dataset in the index
- [] Make sure the number of classess being trained by the model is dynamically chosen based on the data provided
- [] Use a notebook to explore Cat21 and Cat101 to make sure the frame data is correct
- [] Visit your training code and make sure you're capturing F1-score and other metrics
- [] Chat about the best way to save these metric over multiple experiments and implement it
- [] Run a training round on all the data we have so far
- [] Download Cataract1K ðŸ¤¯
